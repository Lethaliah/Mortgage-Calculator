# Mortgage-Calculator
Calculates monthly payments for customers, whose info is read from the txt file 'prospects.txt', then displays the result.
## 
This was programmed using Gradle 7.6 and Java 19.0.2

## Instructions
After downloading the repository, use cmd to enter the folder of the files (in my case 'cd gradle', 'cd mortgagecalculator'). 
Build the project with 'gradlew build'. The first window is from a test, and the second the program itself. 
You run the program with 'java -jar build\libs\mortgageCalculator.jar'.
